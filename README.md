### Global Tech News Aggregator

Coffee <and> Bytes is a web project designed to automatically scrape and display the latest technology news articles from around the world. The goal of the project is to provide users with quick, readable summaries of tech articles while linking back to the original sources.

The scraper runs hourly and collects new articles that are publicly accessible. Each article includes the title, author, publication date, summary, and original URL. Articles are stored in a database and displayed dynamically on the website.

Users can browse the homepage to see recent tech articles and click into individual pages for more detailed summaries. The project also includes an admin section for future expansion, allowing for management of displayed content.

The design theme of the site is inspired by a code editor, featuring a clean, dark interface tailored for developers and tech enthusiasts.
